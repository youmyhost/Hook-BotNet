## What is Botnet

 A botnet, also referred to as a "robot network," is a collection of computers that have been infected with malicious software and are controlled by a single attacker known as the "bot-herder." Each individual computer within the botnet is called a bot. Through a centralized command center, the attacker can instruct all the computers in the botnet to carry out coordinated criminal activities simultaneously. The sheer size of a botnet, often consisting of millions of bots, allows the attacker to execute large-scale actions that were previously unattainable with malware alone. Since the botnet remains under the control of the remote attacker, infected machines can receive updates and modify their behavior in real-time. Consequently, bot-herders frequently exploit the black market by renting access to segments of their botnet, resulting in significant financial gains.

#### Summary 

DukeEugene, an actor in the cyber world, is known for promoting two Android-based malware families called Hook and ERMAC. Hook, the latest variant released by this actor, was unveiled at the beginning of 2023. According to the actor's announcement, Hook was developed entirely from scratch [1]. To delve deeper into the technical variances between these malware families, our research involved analyzing two samples of Hook and two samples of ERMAC.

After conducting our investigation, we reached the conclusion that the Hook malware was built upon the foundation of the ERMAC source code. All 30 commands available for the malware operator to send to an ERMAC-infected device are also present in Hook. The implementation of these commands is almost identical. ERMAC primarily focuses on functionalities such as sending SMS messages, displaying phishing windows on legitimate apps, extracting lists of installed applications, SMS messages, and accounts, as well as automatically stealing recovery seed phrases from multiple cryptocurrency wallets.

Hook, on the other hand, introduces a plethora of new features, boasting an additional 38 commands when compared to the latest version of ERMAC. The most intriguing additions in Hook include the ability to stream the victim's screen and interact with the device's interface to gain complete control, capturing photos using the front-facing camera, pilfering cookies associated with Google login sessions, and supporting the theft of recovery seeds from additional cryptocurrency wallets.

Despite its relatively short lifespan, Hook made its debut announcement on January 12th, 2023, and its closure was declared on April 19th, 2023, citing the actor's departure for a "special military operation." On May 11th, 2023, the actors claimed that the source code for Hook had been sold for a sum of $70,000. If these statements hold true, it is possible that we may witness intriguing new iterations of Hook in the future.
