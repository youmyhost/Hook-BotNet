## What is Botnet

 A botnet, also referred to as a "robot network," is a collection of computers that have been infected with malicious software and are controlled by a single attacker known as the "bot-herder." Each individual computer within the botnet is called a bot. Through a centralized command center, the attacker can instruct all the computers in the botnet to carry out coordinated criminal activities simultaneously. The sheer size of a botnet, often consisting of millions of bots, allows the attacker to execute large-scale actions that were previously unattainable with malware alone. Since the botnet remains under the control of the remote attacker, infected machines can receive updates and modify their behavior in real-time. Consequently, bot-herders frequently exploit the black market by renting access to segments of their botnet, resulting in significant financial gains.
